## Improved UX for Ionic apps with Skeleton Loading Screens

### Ionic Free Starter App
UI Skeletons, Ghost Elements, Shell Elements? They are all the same! Think of them as cool content placeholders that are shown where the content will eventually be once it becomes available. 

This repo is part of [Ionic Skeleton Components Tutorial](https://ionicthemes.com/tutorials/about/improved-ux-for-ionic-apps-with-skeleton-loading-screens) where you will learn the importance of adopting the App Shell pattern in your ionic apps.
